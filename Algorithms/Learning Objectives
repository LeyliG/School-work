Currently studying the Algorithms based on the materials from the Introduction to Algorithms course
taught at the MIT: 
http://ocw.mit.edu/6-006F11

Future plans is to continue exploring the subject and move onto the materials from the 
"Design and Analysis of Algorithms" also taught at the MIT:
http://ocw.mit.edu/6-046JS15

From there, I am planning on narrowing down the topic and exploring the Genetic Algorithms.
