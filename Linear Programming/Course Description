# College of William and Mary
# Csci 628 – Linear Programming - Fall 2017

Instructor: Anh Ninh

Description: 
The main purpose is to cover a broad spectrum of topics in linear programming. 
Basic materials such as the simplex method and duality theory, as well as some introduction 
to related techniques, such as dynamic programing and integer programming will be covered. 
A good part of the course is devoted to the modeling power of linear programming and its 
applications particularly in business disciplines such as supply chains, finance, marketing etc. 
Also, modeling language AMPL for building LP models for simple applications is introduce, 
and a related optimization package to solve small numerical examples is used.

Text books:
The course does not have a required text book. Lecture notes will be posted to the course web site at blackboard.wm.edu when necessary.
