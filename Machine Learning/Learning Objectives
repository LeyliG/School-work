Currently, I am exploring the Machine learning field by using the resources offered by 
- Google: "Machine Learning Crash Course"
- AWS Training: "Math for Machine Learning"
- Independent study: "Neural Networks"


Future objective is to move onto the materials from a Coursera class offered by deeplearning.ai
"Neural Networks and Deep Learning"
