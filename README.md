# School-work
This repo is for code I wrote for problems assigned as part of my graduate level classes or solutions for related problems.

Classes taken so far are:
1. Linear Programming (used AMPL)
2. Network Optimization (used Python)
3. Supply Chain Optimization (used Python)
4. Computing (used multiple tools and languages, including R)
5. Probability
6. Data Mining (using R)
7. Big Data (using Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, Scala, and AWS)
8. Network Location Theory (used AMPL)
9. Simulation and Modeling (used R and SIMAN/Arena)
10. Applied Linear Regression (used R, Minitab, and Excel)
11. Database Management (MySQL)


Self-learning subjects:
1. Algorithms
2. Machine Learning (Neural Networks)
4. Mathematical Statistics
