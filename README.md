This repo is for code I wrote for problems assigned as part of my graduate level classes or solutions for related problems.

Classes taken so far are:
1. Linear Programming (used AMPL)
2. Network Optimization (used Python)
3. Supply Chain Optimization (used Python)
4. Computing (used multiple tools and languages, including R and C)
