Instructor: Anke van Zuylen

Description
Network flow problems are a subclass of linear programming problems, with many applications
in a wide range of areas such as computer networking, manufacturing, telecommunications and 
transportation, but also in finance, health care, social and defense contexts. 
In this course, we surveyed algorithms for applications of network flow problems.

We focused on the following four problems.
  • Maximum flows
  • Shortest paths
  • Minimum cost flows
  • Minimum spanning trees

Goals and objectives included: 
  • obtaining knowledge of key network optimization problems, and algorithms for solving them;
  • learning how to model real-world applications using network flows;
  • developing algorithmic thinking skills, including
      - finding an algorithm’s "weaknesses" or proving they do not exist (correctness),
      - running time analysis.

We used Python and the Python NetworkX package for hands-on practice implementing
the algorithms we covered in class.
